Flow
====

A C# coroutine-based Kernel for .Net. If you are one of the many developers using this library, I encourage you provide any feedback and/or fork.

This is Unity-friendly and will work on all versions of Unity after 4.0. Please let me know otherwise.

Current documentation is at http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/177397/Indepth_Flow__A_coroutine_kernel_for_Net.php but the formatting is a bit screwy.
